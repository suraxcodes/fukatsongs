# fukatSongs 🎵

fukatSongs is a feature-rich, entirely local, ad-free personal Android music streaming app built with Flutter. It seamlessly integrates searches across YouTube Music and JioSaavn, providing high-fidelity streaming, offline downloads, and stable queue management without the need for a backend server.

**Core Value:** Stable, uninterrupted music playback with a reliable queue system, local offline storage, and zero cloud dependency.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎧 Core Playback & Audio Engine
*   **System-Level Dynamic Island:** A globally persistent, interactive "Dynamic Island" overlay that stays on your screen even when you exit the app. Features include real-time metadata syncing, animated wavebars, tap-to-expand UI, swipe-to-skip gestures, and long-press to dismiss.
*   **Extensible Plugin Architecture:** A robust `PluginService` and `CrossPluginResolver` system that allows effortless addition of new streaming sources. The app currently queries and streams from JioSaavn and YouTube Music APIs in parallel, seamlessly falling back to alternative sources if one fails.
*   **Multi-Tunnel Proxy Rotation:** A resilient proxy rotation mechanism designed to seamlessly bypass aggressive rate-limiting or geographic blocks from remote servers.
*   **"Infinite Music" (Smart Autoplay):** Radio-like infinite playback. When the queue ends, the application intelligently searches for and appends top tracks from the most recently played artist.
*   **Reorderable Queue Management:** Full drag-and-drop support within the immersive player's "Up Next" section, allowing users to effortlessly curate their active listening session.
*   **High-Fidelity Audio:** Configurable streaming and download quality modes, intelligently adapting to network conditions (e.g., automatically starting at 160kbps on mobile data to prevent stuttering).
*   **Built-in Equalizer & Loudness Enhancer:** Native Android audio effects pipeline (`AndroidLoudnessEnhancer`, `AndroidEqualizer`) for deep bass and up to +4dB volume boosting.
*   **Gapless Playback:** Custom audio buffering logic to eliminate "pops" and reduce buffering delays during track transitions.

### 📚 Library & Discovery
*   **Smart Library Organization:** Advanced dynamic sorting engine across Downloads, Playlists, and Liked Songs tabs. Users can sort by Title, Artist, Album, Recently Added, Duration, and Custom Order.
*   **Customizable UI Views:** Toggleable View Modes (List vs. Compact Grid), empowering users to prioritize high-resolution artwork or dense text lists for larger music collections.
*   **Background Playlist Importer:** A robust, asynchronous importer that seamlessly migrates massive playlists from Spotify and YouTube directly into the app. Features include real-time progress indicators, background execution, and the ability to cancel or hide the import dialog without interrupting the process.
*   **Intelligent Search History:** The search home interface displays a curated horizontal list of actual recently played songs alongside a persistent query history, mimicking the fluidity of premium streaming services.
*   **Personalized Listening Stats:** A dynamic "Your Top Songs" section that tracks local playback counts, automatically elevating your most listened-to tracks to the top of the search dashboard.
*   **Artist & Album Browsing:** Dedicated, immersive browse screens dynamically generated for exploring complete artist discographies and album tracklists.
*   **Synced Lyrics Engine:** High-precision, real-time synchronized lyrics integration powered by the LRCLIB API.

### 💾 Offline & Utilities
*   **Zero-Cloud Local Storage:** Instantaneous loading of metadata, playlists, liked songs, and application settings via a blazing-fast local NoSQL key-value store (`Hive`).
*   **Offline Downloads:** Download any track for offline listening. Audio files are saved directly to application-specific storage.
*   **Storage Management:** Built-in utility dashboard to monitor disk usage and manually clear specific caches or downloaded files.
*   **Sleep Timer:** Set a customized countdown timer to automatically fade out and stop playback when falling asleep.
*   **Intelligent Queue Shuffling:** Maintains absolute state synchronization between `originalQueue` and `shuffledQueue`, allowing users to toggle shuffle without destructively modifying their original playlist order.
*   **Background Playback & Lockscreen:** Full Android background execution support via `audio_service`, featuring lock-screen controls, media session management, and responsive push notifications.
*   **Developer Sandbox:** Built-in isolated testing environments (like `ProviderTestScreen`) to rapidly prototype and test new raw stream URLs without risking the stability of the core app pipeline.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

### Architecture & State Management
*   **Framework:** Flutter (Android only for V1)
*   **State Management:** `flutter_riverpod` (v2.5.1) with code-generation (`riverpod_annotation`).

### Audio & Networking
*   **Audio Engine:** `just_audio` (v0.9.36) and `audio_service` (v0.18.13). Handles HLS, MP3, M4A, and OPUS formats.
*   **Network Client:** `dio` (v5.4.0) with custom interceptors for retries, auth, and download streaming.
*   **API Interactions:** `youtube_explode_dart` (for YT metadata) and direct JioSaavn API interactions.

### Local Storage & Data
*   **Database:** `hive` (v2.2.3) & `hive_flutter`.
*   **File System:** `path_provider` and `permission_handler` for Android 13+ storage & audio permissions.
*   **Models:** `freezed` and `json_serializable` for immutable, boilerplate-free data classes.

### UI & UX
*   **Image Caching:** `cached_network_image`.
*   **Responsiveness:** `flutter_screenutil` for perfect scaling across all Android device sizes.

## 🏗 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
*   Flutter SDK (3.19.0 or higher recommended)
*   Android Studio / Android SDK (API level 34+)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fukat_songs.git
   cd freesongs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run Code Generation:**
   Since the app relies heavily on Freezed and Riverpod annotations, you must run the build runner to generate the `.g.dart` and `.freezed.dart` files.
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Run the App:**
   Connect an Android emulator or physical device.
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Building the APK
To build a production-ready APK split by architecture (reduces app size):
```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```
The output APKs will be located in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`.

## ⚠️ Constraints & Disclaimers
*   **Android Exclusive:** Version 1 is strictly optimized for Android. iOS support is not currently planned due to background audio limitations and file system constraints.
*   **API Volatility:** This application relies on unofficial APIs (YouTube Music, JioSaavn). Stream URLs are intentionally never persisted in the database; they are dynamically resolved at playback time to prevent broken streams.
*   **Single Instance Player:** The app strictly enforces a single global `AudioPlayer` instance to prevent memory leaks and overlapping audio states.
